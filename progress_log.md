# Squire Progress Log

> Detailed notes and decisions made during development. Useful for tracking progress between sessions and avoiding context limits.

---

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Session Start

- Initial setup and scaffolding completed.
- Monorepo structure created (`apps/`, `functions/`, `infra/`).
- Root `package.json` with `turbo` added.
- `checklist.md` and `progress_log.md` created.
- Next steps involve defining the Supabase infra and starting the Spike phase.

--- 

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Data Model & Migration

- Revised plan to focus on core agent actions, Supabase data model, web dashboard, and daily email digest, deferring immediate SMS.
- Updated `demo_scoring_agent_context.md.md` and `checklist.md` to reflect the new plan.
- Created `features.md` to track backlog items.
- Defined SQL schema for core tables: `users`, `emails`, `email_classifications`, `email_actions`, `daily_digests`.
- Created migration file `infra/supabase/migrations/20250501120000_create_core_tables.sql`.
- Applied migration to Supabase project `yxwaqmbdgritbubuwbus` using integrated tools.
- Fixed `packageManager` issue in `package.json`.
- Created `turbo.json` file.
- Next step: Implement Gmail API OAuth in the Chrome Extension.

--- 

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Extension Auth Setup

- Applied RLS policies to Supabase tables via SQL Editor.
- Confirmed RLS is enabled for all necessary tables via SQL query.
- Updated extension `manifest.json`:
    - Added `gmail.modify` scope.
    - Pointed background script to `background.ts`.
- Renamed extension `.js` files (`background`, `popup`) to `.ts`.
- Added basic `authenticate` function using `chrome.identity.getAuthToken` to `background.ts`.
- Added listeners to `background.ts` to trigger auth on icon click and attempt silent auth on install/update.
- Commented out previous background logic for later refactoring.
- Fixed `turbo.json` syntax error (`pipeline` -> `tasks`).
- Next step: User to configure Google Cloud Console OAuth credentials and update `manifest.json` with Client ID.

--- 

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Extension Refactoring & Types

- Added `@types/chrome` dev dependency to `apps/extension` and ran `npm install`.
- Refactored `apps/extension/src/background.ts`:
    - Re-integrated constants, API helpers (`fetchGmailAPI`), storage helpers.
    - Re-integrated core email fetching logic (`fetchUnreadEmails`) using new `authenticate` function.
    - Added basic email body pre-processing (text/plain extraction).
    - Re-integrated Chrome Alarm setup (`onInstalled`, `onAlarm`).
    - Improved `onMessage` listener logic.
    - Added placeholder for `callClassificationService`.
- Next Step: User needs to perform Google Cloud OAuth setup and update `manifest.json` with Client ID.
- Following User Action: Refine `classify_email` Python function.

--- 

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Classification Function Refinement

- Refactored `functions/python/classify_email/app.py`:
    - Added `openai` and `json` imports, initialized OpenAI client.
    - Updated `EmailData` Pydantic model to include `user_id`.
    - Updated `ClassificationResult` Pydantic model: renamed `confidence` to `real_human_probability_score` (int 0-100), added `summary` and `suggested_action` (enum: delete, archive, etc.).
    - Revised OpenAI function calling definition (`classification_tool`) to match new Pydantic models and PRD requirements (human probability score, suggested action).
    - Updated system prompt for OpenAI call.
    - Implemented the actual `client.chat.completions.create` call using `gpt-4o-mini` and the function tool.
    - Added robust parsing and validation for the OpenAI function call response.
    - Updated Supabase logging helper (`log_classification_to_supabase`) to use the refined data structure, log to `email_classifications` table, and use `user_id` from the request.
    - Removed placeholder SMS logic (`call_sms_service`) as per revised plan.
    - Improved error handling.
- Updated `checklist.md` to mark this task complete.
- Next Step: Implement core agent actions in the Chrome Extension (`apps/extension/src/background.ts`) based on the classification results.

--- 

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Implement Core Agent Actions (Background Script)

- Modified `apps/extension/src/background.ts`:
    - Updated `callClassificationService` to call the real backend service (`http://localhost:8000/classify`), pass `userId`, and handle the `ClassificationResult` type.
    - Added Gmail API helper functions: `getOrCreateLabel` (with in-memory caching), `applyGmailModifications`, `trashGmailMessage`.
    - Integrated classification and action logic into the `fetchUnreadEmails` loop:
        - Retrieved `userId` using `chrome.identity.getProfileUserInfo` (corrected promise handling).
        - Called `callClassificationService` for each relevant email.
        - Implemented a `switch` statement based on `suggested_action` to trigger:
            - Trash (`trashGmailMessage`).
            - Archive (`applyGmailModifications` removing `INBOX`).
            - Labeling (`getOrCreateLabel` + `applyGmailModifications`), including logic to archive or keep in inbox based on the suggested action.
    - Added TODOs for specific `draft_response` and `forward_to_altbot` implementation details.
    - Fixed linter errors related to `chrome` declaration and `getProfileUserInfo` usage.
- Updated `checklist.md` to mark agent actions as partially complete.
- Next Step: Implement more robust email pre-processing in `background.ts`.

--- 

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Implement Email Pre-processing

- Added `preprocessEmailBody` helper function to `apps/extension/src/background.ts`.
    - Removes common quoted reply headers (e.g., lines starting with '>', 'On ... wrote:').
    - Removes content below signature separators ('-- ', '__________').
    - Trims excess whitespace.
- Integrated `preprocessEmailBody` into `fetchUnreadEmails` loop to clean the body before sending it to the classification service.
- Updated `checklist.md` to mark pre-processing as complete.
- Next Step: Implement "Draft Response" action logic (saving draft info to Supabase).

--- 

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Implement Draft Request Creation

- Created Supabase migration `infra/supabase/migrations/20250502120000_create_draft_requests_table.sql` for a new `draft_requests` table to track emails needing drafts.
    - Includes columns for `user_id`, `gmail_message_id`, `classification_id`, `status`, `llm_summary`, `generated_draft_content`.
    - Fixed foreign key type mismatch (`classification_id` to `UUID`).
    - Fixed trigger function call (`moddatetime` -> `trigger_set_timestamp`).
    - Applied migration successfully.
- Created Supabase Edge Function `functions/node/create_draft_request/index.ts`:
    - Accepts POST requests with `userId`, `gmailMessageId`, `classificationId`, `llmSummary`.
    - Inserts a new record into the `draft_requests` table.
    - Handles unique constraint errors and other potential errors.
    - Deployed the Edge Function.
- Updated Python classification service (`functions/python/classify_email/app.py`):
    - Modified `/classify` endpoint to retrieve and return the `id` of the record inserted into `email_classifications` as `classificationLogId`.
- Updated Chrome Extension background script (`apps/extension/src/background.ts`):
    - Added `classificationLogId` to the `ClassificationResult` interface.
    - Implemented logic within the `draft_response` action case to call the `create_draft_request` Edge Function via `fetch`, passing necessary data and the user's auth token.
- Updated `checklist.md` to mark draft response action as complete.
- Next Step: Set up basic Next.js app structure in `apps/web`.

---

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Basic Web App Setup

- Successfully initialized a new Next.js project in `apps/web` using `create-next-app` with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and the App Router.
- Resolved a conflict caused by initializing `shadcn/ui` before `create-next-app` by removing the existing `apps/web` directory and rerunning the commands in the correct order.
- Initialized `shadcn/ui` within the `apps/web` project, handling React 19 dependency issues.
- Updated `checklist.md`.
- Next Step: Build the initial structure for the User Dashboard page (`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`).

--- 

## [[YYYY-MM-DD]] - Web App Landing Page Integration & Fixes

- **Detour:** Spent significant time integrating and debugging the landing page components copied from the standalone `hopper/landingpage` prototype into the main `apps/web` Next.js application.
- **Troubleshooting:**
    - Resolved hydration errors in `Hero.tsx` and `ProblemSection.tsx` caused by using `Math.random()` directly in style props during SSR. Fixed by generating random styles within `useEffect` hooks triggered after client-side mount.
    - Fixed animation logic in `ProblemSection.tsx` to use `whileInView` for opacity transitions while still using state for positioning to avoid hydration issues.
    - Identified and resolved Tailwind CSS/PostCSS configuration issues stemming from migrating from Tailwind v3 (in `hopper`) to v4 (initially in `apps/web`) alongside Turbopack.
        - Errors included `Cannot apply unknown utility class` for `border-border`, `bg-background`, `text-foreground`.
        - Resolved by downgrading `apps/web` to Tailwind v3.3.3, ensuring correct `postcss.config.js` (CommonJS format), and installing missing `shadcn/ui` components.
- **Refactoring:**
    - Refactored `Header.tsx` to use correct branding ("Squire", `ShieldCheck` icon), standard `shadcn/ui` components/styling, and added a basic mobile menu.
    - Identified and installed numerous missing `shadcn/ui` components in `apps/web` that were present in `hopper/landingpage`.
- **Cleanup:** Addressed file structure inconsistencies (duplicate UI directories, config file extensions).
- **Status:** Landing page sections (`Hero`, `Problem`, etc.) are now rendering correctly with styles and animations within `apps/web`.
- **Next Step:** Set up Git repository and Vercel deployment configuration.

## [2025-05-03] - Vercel Build Debugging & Fixes

- Investigated Vercel build failure (`No Next.js version detected`).
- Added explicit `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` to **root** `package.json` `devDependencies` so the Vercel Turbo detector always finds a Next.js version at the repo root.
- Reproduced build locally with `npx turbo run build --filter=web`.
    - Hit compile error: `Unknown font Geist / Geist Mono` coming from `next/font/google` import.
- **Switch to Vercel's `geist` package**:
    - Installed `geist@^1.4.1` in `apps/web`.
    - Replaced `next/font/google` import with `geist/font/sans` and `geist/font/mono` in `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`.
    - Simplified usage to `GeistSans.variable` / `GeistMono.variable` CSS vars.
- Confirmed Turbo build now compiles successfully in ~14 s locally (no font error).
- Updated **`apps/web/package.json`** to include new `geist` dependency.
- This should unblock Vercel build (screenshot settings already point `Root Directory = apps/web`, `Build Command = cd ../.. && npx turbo build --filter=web`, etc.).
- Next Step: push changes & retrigger Vercel deployment.

## [2025-05-03] - Vercel Build Debugging (Continued)

- Continued troubleshooting Vercel deployment failures for the `apps/web` Next.js application.
- **Attempt 1:** Modified `vercel.json` build command to `cd apps/web && npm install && npm run build`.
    - **Result:** Fixed initial "Couldn't find app directory" error, but caused a new error: `routes-manifest.json` not found. Turborepo ran from the root but only built the `@squire/extension` package.
- **Attempt 2:** Tried directly executing the local Next binary using `cd apps/web && npm install && $(npm bin)/next build`.
    - **Result:** Failed with `sh: Unknown: command not found`. Vercel's shell didn't support `$(npm bin)`.
- **Attempt 3:** Used `npx --no-install next build` via `cd apps/web && npm install && npx --no-install next build`.
    - **Result:** Failed with `npx canceled due to missing packages`. `npx` still tried to fetch the latest `next` version despite the flag.
- **Attempt 4:** Simplified `vercel.json` by removing `buildCommand` and `installCommand`, relying on Vercel defaults with Root Directory `./`.
    - **Result:** Failed with `routes-manifest.json` not found. Vercel ran `turbo run build` from root but again only included `@squire/extension` in scope.
- **Attempt 5:** Added `buildCommand: "turbo run build --filter=web..."` to explicitly target the `web` package.
    - **Result:** Failed with `No package found with name 'web' in workspace`. Turborepo couldn't find the workspace in the Vercel environment.
- **Attempt 6:** Simplified the filter to `buildCommand: "turbo run build --filter=web"`.
    - **Result:** Failed again with `No package found with name 'web' in workspace`.
- **Current Status:** Vercel builds are consistently failing because Turborepo, when executed via Vercel's build process (either by default or via explicit `buildCommand`), cannot locate the `web` workspace. Root `package.json` and `apps/web/package.json` configurations appear correct.
- **Next Step:** Re-introduce `installCommand: "npm install"` alongside `buildCommand: "turbo run build --filter=web"` in `vercel.json` and ensure Vercel UI overrides are OFF.
