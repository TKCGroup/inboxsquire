# Squire Landing Page - Concept & Plan (v0.1)

> **Goal:** Create a compelling, informative, and visually engaging landing page to drive Chrome Extension installs and introduce users to the Squire value proposition.

---

## 1. Brand Identity & Voice

*   **Name:** Squire
*   **Tagline Options:**
    *   Squire: Your Inbox's Intelligent Gatekeeper.
    *   Squire: Reclaim Your Focus. Master Your Inbox.
    *   Squire: The Executive Assistant for Your Email.
    *   Squire: Stop Drowning in Demos. Start Closing Deals.
*   **Core Concept:** Squire acts as a smart, efficient, and trusted filter for the deluge of vendor emails and cold outreach that plagues busy executives. It brings order, saves precious time, and even surfaces high-potential opportunities.
*   **Voice:** Professional, Confident, Slightly Witty, Efficient, Trustworthy. Emphasizes control, clarity, and reclaimed productivity. Avoids overly technical jargon. Think: "The calm in the inbox storm," or "Your inbox bouncer, but with an MBA."
*   **Target Audience:** Seed-to-Series A executives (CEO, CIO, VP Eng), founders, solo entrepreneurs, decision-makers overwhelmed by sales pitches.
